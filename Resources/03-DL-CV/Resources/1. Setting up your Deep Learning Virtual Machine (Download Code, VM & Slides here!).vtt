WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:00.880
All right.

00:00.880 --> 00:05.500
So welcome to chapter tree where we set up a planning development machine.

00:05.500 --> 00:10.160
So now that you've gone through the intro you're now ready to get started setting up your machine.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.730
So let's get to it.

00:11.740 --> 00:17.380
So now the first step in setting up a deepening virtual machine is you need to download Virtual Box

00:17.440 --> 00:24.100
Virtual Box is a software that allows us to actually start an entirely new operating system whether

00:24.130 --> 00:30.460
it be Linux Windows or Mac OS although it's not fully supported for Mac OS but you can actually run

00:30.490 --> 00:33.500
an entire new operating system with in a virtual box.

00:33.510 --> 00:34.170
It's super cool.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.560
It's called ritualize.

00:35.800 --> 00:43.960
And it is super fast on new use didn't experience any slowdown really and it is entirely useful for

00:43.960 --> 00:49.580
us to set up our deepening machine because deepening software on Windows is not well-supported.

00:49.660 --> 00:55.450
However on Linux or Ubuntu it is a very good environment for running on our software.

00:55.780 --> 01:01.740
So what you do now is you download either to Windows OS X versions according to what you're using.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.480
So I'm not going to be Windows.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.020
I've really done with it here.

01:05.380 --> 01:13.390
So now what you do as well is you download from the link in the resources file download the deepening

01:13.420 --> 01:15.100
C-v open to that.

01:15.180 --> 01:15.950
File.

01:16.210 --> 01:21.450
This is your wish your machine that we're going to set up so that you have those two files.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.840
Here we are ready to get started.

01:23.890 --> 01:27.250
So now we have to firstly install virtual box.

01:27.250 --> 01:30.050
Now I know this file is quite huge just nine gigs.

01:30.220 --> 01:35.470
So you probably would have wanted to leave this overnight if you have a relatively slow broadband connection.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.350
However if you're a fast connection should take about an hour.

01:38.790 --> 01:40.870
Either way let's install virtual box

01:43.800 --> 01:46.150
so you get to run standard procedure.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.600
I'm not going to do the Mac install video because I don't have access to a Mac.

01:52.690 --> 01:55.590
But as soon as I do upload a video for you Mac users.

01:55.720 --> 02:00.340
However it's a standard installation procedure and all the settings are the same but generally for Mac

02:00.400 --> 02:01.370
and Windows.

02:01.420 --> 02:04.150
So this should relate to you as well.

02:04.810 --> 02:06.810
So you leave all the details here as well.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.480
It's best next.

02:08.500 --> 02:17.590
Next again you can optionally can do this if you want find this is fine press yes install.

02:17.610 --> 02:18.150
Do we go

02:23.490 --> 02:23.840
OK.

02:23.870 --> 02:27.600
So we've finished installation process and now you can start.

02:27.650 --> 02:31.130
You'll get your rocks off and I'll show you how to get everything set up.

02:31.130 --> 02:31.470
All right.

02:31.470 --> 02:37.550
So here we are on a virtual box manage your software so please ignore these two virtual machines I have

02:37.550 --> 02:37.820
a break.

02:37.820 --> 02:42.930
No yours is going to be blank right now since semanticists and you're going to be using this.

02:42.950 --> 02:46.730
So go to file and import appliance.

02:46.940 --> 02:52.470
And now go to the directory where you downloaded your virtual box start of the file.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.330
All right.

02:53.460 --> 02:57.260
So go to open and press next.

02:57.260 --> 03:03.070
Now I have it set to my virtual machine to use force use and use it to exit from.

03:03.170 --> 03:05.370
That is basically of course CPI.

03:05.390 --> 03:10.550
So I have it logical cause and I have and get 16 gig of ram in my system.

03:10.550 --> 03:17.110
So you're going to want to put it to at least half of what your host system can support.

03:17.120 --> 03:20.690
So if you have a dual call you can use two here.

03:20.750 --> 03:24.330
And if you have it is a Frahm you can use for gigs here.

03:24.680 --> 03:27.960
So we can make those adjustments and leave everything else the same.

03:27.960 --> 03:32.830
It's fine and good to import.

03:33.020 --> 03:37.840
And now this time is basically a lie it's going to take maybe about 10 20 minutes.

03:37.840 --> 03:42.820
So I'm going to pause the video here and when it's done we can start off with your machine and I'll

03:42.820 --> 03:43.780
show you how to use it.

03:43.780 --> 03:47.580
It's quite easy and we'll get done it and set up whole code.

03:47.710 --> 03:48.960
And that should be at

03:51.780 --> 03:52.140
OK.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.000
So that's it.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.430
We have just installed virtual machine.

03:56.460 --> 04:00.050
So now this is the new one here because I already have it working here.

04:00.050 --> 04:02.960
It came up as under school one knows is going to be this one.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.980
So either way it's the same machine.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.230
So let's just start this one fresh one I just installed.

04:10.160 --> 04:21.270
It takes about maybe tity seconds to boot up at least on my system.

04:21.430 --> 04:24.340
This is all normal by the way it's a pudding's screenful and Ventoux

04:33.510 --> 04:34.120
There we go.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.650
So we're loaded.

04:35.880 --> 04:36.770
Oh yes.

04:36.780 --> 04:37.670
This is pretty cool.

04:37.670 --> 04:41.470
So now you're actually running Ubuntu within Windows.

04:41.850 --> 04:45.660
And it's because it's using of which lies those features on your CD.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.430
It's going to run pretty quick.

04:47.430 --> 04:49.460
You're not going to notice much of a slowdown.

04:49.470 --> 04:52.110
So what I want to do is two things I want to show you.

04:52.110 --> 04:55.580
First of all your password for your virtual machine.

04:55.800 --> 05:01.950
Whenever you do sudo or any sort of flick system settings we change users and stuff the password for

05:01.950 --> 05:05.960
this user is 1 1 2 2 treat 3 4 4.

05:06.180 --> 05:11.820
It's going to be in the touch resources of your file and I'm going to display it on screen as well.

05:11.940 --> 05:13.260
So you don't forget it.

05:13.290 --> 05:17.130
So let's just see something here.

05:17.130 --> 05:23.090
So what I want to show you is that we have our old machine this is all file structure here.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.640
So this is a home directory right now.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.690
We have a bunch of things installed here right now.

05:29.190 --> 05:33.380
Basically this these things are a lot of deepening libraries.

05:33.420 --> 05:38.550
And I have some instructions as well you don't need to use these right now but what I want to show you

05:38.550 --> 05:42.310
is to basically set up your code and train models.

05:42.330 --> 05:42.880
OK.

05:43.170 --> 05:44.300
So stay tuned.

05:44.650 --> 05:44.950
OK.

05:44.970 --> 05:53.210
So what I'm going to need you to do is open Firefox that's a web browser on the buntu by default and

05:53.210 --> 06:01.800
what to do is when Firefox boots up I want you to go to your dummy account when you come and with the

06:01.840 --> 06:07.460
attached resources to this lesson which is also the deep linning code library.

06:07.540 --> 06:11.950
Let's just wait for it to boot up here I think my system has a lot of stuff running right now.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.820
But either way just go to your dummy dot com

06:17.690 --> 06:19.650
and is like Friday so we're on right now.

06:19.650 --> 06:20.750
Nice.

06:20.780 --> 06:24.290
So what to do is basically log into your account.

06:24.470 --> 06:25.840
However you've done it before.

06:25.880 --> 06:32.300
Whichever method you use and download the resources for this for the course that's the code and Treen

06:32.300 --> 06:38.270
model is zip file and download it and it's going to save in your Downloads folder right here.

06:38.270 --> 06:39.470
This is the same file.

06:40.010 --> 06:42.620
And this is a file once you extract.

06:42.740 --> 06:50.720
So double click and this file is going to take a bit to 10 seconds or so to open it's a big file.

06:50.750 --> 06:53.990
So it's reasonable.

06:54.180 --> 07:00.120
And this file here I want you to extract it to your home directory here.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.370
So let's go ahead and do that

07:05.210 --> 07:08.020
let's just reduce this clutter in the background.

07:09.010 --> 07:13.630
And this takes about a minute actually less much less 10 minutes to extract

07:22.690 --> 07:31.350
and when it's done you will see all the code that we need for this course is in a convenient location.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.130
So just quit this

07:35.680 --> 07:36.270
close

07:39.700 --> 07:40.850
and doing something.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.750
But that's fine.

07:42.760 --> 07:48.510
What I want to do is go to home and now you see just Eritrea de-planing CV and it is also a shortcut

07:48.630 --> 07:50.530
to do the same directory.

07:50.850 --> 07:52.770
And let's go back to it here.

07:52.830 --> 07:55.620
This is decomp.

07:55.620 --> 08:00.020
The contents of this are actually sortable and list here.

08:00.030 --> 08:05.360
These are this is all the code entery Mullins is going to need the discourse and it's conveniently extracted

08:05.360 --> 08:07.210
now within your virtual machine.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.070
So now let's go back to Python.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.460
Sorry Otunnu.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.150
So let's play this.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.580
So what if we wanted to test our code.

08:16.880 --> 08:26.090
So what do you do you go to you press source type source activate C-v that's what the plumbing environment

08:26.090 --> 08:27.100
for computer vision.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.680
And it's instantly done.

08:28.730 --> 08:30.860
And now you type python.

08:31.420 --> 08:34.890
Notebook and magic happens.

08:34.890 --> 08:39.390
What this does it starts a local server that hosts your it on the browser.

08:39.900 --> 08:45.240
So now this is where we run all our Python code and I'm going is going to do a brief tutorial on that

08:45.260 --> 08:45.870
here.

08:46.130 --> 08:51.100
So now just good de-planing CV that's just good chapter for getting started.

08:51.450 --> 08:54.990
And let's run our Actually let's run our life sketching

08:59.390 --> 09:03.020
because this loads much quicker and we don't need any files for this.

09:03.020 --> 09:06.870
So let's run this block of code.

09:07.070 --> 09:11.450
I put on the books are basically just blocks of code we can run and all the variables everything is

09:11.450 --> 09:13.460
stored inside of it.

09:13.910 --> 09:19.400
So you press shift and still control and to shift and to run it here.

09:19.430 --> 09:25.820
This takes about maybe five seconds or less every print division up and see that we're we're using 3.4.

09:26.150 --> 09:29.440
If you press Allt and you get a new line below.

09:29.480 --> 09:34.690
So that's sometimes convenient sometimes not shift into just runs it with our precinct producing this

09:34.700 --> 09:36.020
new cell here.

09:36.170 --> 09:38.890
And to delete that espress cut.

09:38.960 --> 09:46.460
So now let's run our sketch now before we do this we're going to have to go with devices here webcams

09:46.490 --> 09:48.930
and take off integrated webcam.

09:49.280 --> 09:54.490
And now let's press shift into to run this block of gold.

09:54.530 --> 09:55.050
There we go.

09:55.130 --> 09:59.320
So this is our browser all lives this is me chatting here.

09:59.540 --> 10:00.590
This is my microphone.

10:00.590 --> 10:01.910
The door is in the back.

10:01.910 --> 10:04.450
So this is pretty cool isn't it.

10:04.850 --> 10:08.480
So that's close us and that is it.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.270
So we have all of the code here.

10:10.310 --> 10:16.020
Everything is preinstalled all the terror Karris tends to flow a bunch of supporting libraries.

10:16.080 --> 10:21.410
The lib is installed a lot of things are stored Actually it probably takes about an hour to do even

10:21.600 --> 10:23.400
with some sometimes to install everything.

10:23.750 --> 10:24.350
So that's it.

10:24.350 --> 10:27.930
You have your full video machine running here.
